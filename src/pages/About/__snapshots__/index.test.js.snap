                Our Story
              </h1>
              We started Next by Pacific Life with the goal of creating a better, seamless digital experience for the modern investor. We talked to all types of customers. What became clear is customers wanted simple, easy-to-understand products with clear value propositions. We are creating transparent products and an engaging customer experience by starting with the customer and working backwards.

                            We strive to design products that are easy to use and understand. While it might seem that adding optional benefits to a product offers flexibility, it can increase complexity. Keeping the focus on fundamental value results in a better experience for the customer.
